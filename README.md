Name: Noah Nielsen

Hi all! My name is Noah. I was born and raised in the Salt Lake Valley here in Utah, USA. I'm interested in all things creative, from digital art and animation to music to making games. I'm working two jobs right now and it's been a struggle finding time to work on schoolwork. I work as a janitor at Temple Square and as a delivery driver for Pizza Hut.

I served a mission in the Vanuatu Port Vila mission, on an island called New Caledonia. I learned French in the MTC. I have lots of mission stories, haha.

My plans right now are to learn C# and start making some basic games in the Unity game engine. I'm excited to learn more about Python and GitHub and all that fun stuff!
